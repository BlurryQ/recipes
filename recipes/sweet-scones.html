                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    Mary Berry's scones are the perfect easy tea-time treat, whether jam-and-cream-topped (in whichever order you like), plain or packed with sultanas.

                    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                        <ul>
                                <li><strong>450g</strong> self-raising flour</li>
                                <li><strong>2 tsp</strong> baking powder</li>
                                <li><strong>50g</strong> caster sugar</li>
                                <li><strong>100g</strong> butter (softened)</li>
                                <li><strong>50ml</strong> milk</li>
                                <li><strong>2</strong> eggs</li>
                                <li><em>sultanas (optional)</em></li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>Method</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>
                                Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Lightly grease two baking trays.
                            <li><h3>Step 2</h3></li>
                                Put the flour, baking powder and sugar in a large bowl. Add the butter and rub in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.
                            <li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>
                                Crack the eggs into a measuring jug, then add enough milk to make the total liquid 300ml/10fl oz. Stir the egg and milk into the flour – you may not need it all – and mix to a soft, sticky dough.
                            <li><h3>Step 4</h3></li>
                                Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface, knead lightly and work in the sultanas, if using. Roll out to a rectangle about 2cm/¾in thick.
                            <li><h3>Step 5</h3></li>
                                Cut into as many rounds as possible with a fluted 5cm/2in cutter and place them on the prepared baking trays. Brush the tops of the scones with a little extra milk, or any egg and milk left in the jug.
                            <li><h3>Step 6</h3></li>
                                Bake for 12–15 minutes, or until the scones are well risen and a pale, golden-brown colour. Lift onto a wire rack to cool. Eat as fresh as possible.
                        </ol>
